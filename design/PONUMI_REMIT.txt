audience being present in a room,
acknowledge that present
and being present with each other

the sounds themselves are based on psycho-accoustic experiments
 our physical bodies are things that link to larger histories
that is a source of compassion
The poem of your name includes your ancestors names
Our biological history - It's undeniable
