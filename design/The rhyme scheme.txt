The rhyme scheme.  

Rhyme/off-rhyme are defined in relationship to an anchor syllable, usually the first syllable in a name.



12-syllable lines, in a pattern that repeats every four lines.
(x is off-rhyme, o is on-rhyme, A is anchor)

1 oxooxxAoxoox
2 ooxxxoAooxxA
3 ooxxooxxooxx
4 oxooxxAoxxoA


Applying to a name:

Step 1- Phoneme to Mora. Goal is 8-syllable moraic name

Evie Jackson = I VI JA KA SO N

This is only 6 syllables, it needs two more to make a full 8-syllable name.
 
Step 2- I take two syllables from one generation up, Alan, and add that to the end. 

So it becomes:

I VI JA KA SO N A RA

Step 3- Arbitrarily, three syllables are defined as in-rhyme (in bold), the rest off-rhyme, and "I" is the anchor

_I_ _VI_ JA KA SO _N_ A RA

Step 4- then you fill in each line using the syllable order left to right, starting again with each line... 

vi ja n vi ka so i n a vi n ra
vi n ja ka so vi i n vi a ra i
vi n ja ka vi n so a vi n ra ja
vi ja n vi ka so i n a ra vi i
